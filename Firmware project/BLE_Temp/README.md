# nrf51-ble-tutorial-service
This example is meant to be used togheter with the tutorial "BLE Services, a beginner's tutorial" found on https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/8/ble-services-a-beginners-tutorial/. The purpose of the tutorial is to get you started with the basics of the nRF51x22 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). More specifically this tutorial will go through the bare minimum of steps to get your first services up and running. The tutorial is fairly superficial and is meant to be a hands-on introduction to BLE services. It is intended to be a natural continuation of the tutorial "BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial".
